/**
 * The take's item use answered to whoever DRAWS the real player, so the first
 * person hand plays it.
 *
 * <p>The hand you see in first person is drawn by vanilla's own
 * {@code HeldItemRenderer}, and it asks the LIVE player what it is using - a
 * film raises nothing there, so a take that drew a bow used to hold it limp.
 * The same question decides the item's model, in the hand and in the hotbar
 * alike (a drawn bow is the {@code bow_pulling} model, picked by a predicate
 * that asks the holder).</p>
 *
 * <p>Nothing is written onto the player. Writing was tried first - the two use
 * fields take, but the "using an item" living flag does not survive the write
 * (the client's own tick owns that tracked byte), and forcing it would also
 * make vanilla's {@code handleInputEvents} fire a release packet at the server
 * every tick. The film's use is not something the player DOES, it is something
 * their hand is drawn as - so it lives here and is handed out on the way to the
 * screen, through {@code LivingEntityFilmUseMixin}.</p>
 *
 * <p>Which is also why it only answers during the render pass: the frame opens
 * it (the film controller publishes the state at the start of the world render)
 * and the next client tick closes it, so everything gameplay-side - the input
 * handling, the entity tick - keeps seeing the honest "not using anything".</p>
