/**
 * A {@link ModelWeld} resolved against a concrete model. The weld seals a bending joint by pulling both
 * bones' welded faces onto a shared seam, so the bend distributes across both cubes (the parent's face
 * shears to meet the child's, the child's shears back) instead of only the child deforming against a rigid
 * parent.
 *
 * <p>A bone is usually two coincident cubes — the base skin and the inflated jacket layer. Each layer is a
 * different size, so they get their OWN seam: the cubes of the two bones are paired by matching welded-face
 * cross-section (base to base, jacket to jacket — whether the layers differ by inflate or by raw size) and
 * every pair seals independently. A single shared seam would drag the base layer out to the jacket's size
 * and puff the joint.
 *
 * <p>Because the parent draws before the child, the rigid world poses of both faces can't be known in one
 * traversal — the renderer runs a capture pass first (the renderer fills {@link Layer#resetCapture} state),
 * then {@link Layer#computeSeam}, then the draw pass snaps to {@link Layer#seam}.
