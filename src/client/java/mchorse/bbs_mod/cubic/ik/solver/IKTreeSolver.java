/**
 * Damped-least-squares IK over channel angles for a whole {@link IKTree} —
 * ONE solver for any chain length and any number of merged chains, modeled on
 * Blender's behavior, implemented from the standard DLS literature (Buss).
 *
 * <p>Each iteration builds the Jacobian of every effector position over every
 * unlocked channel (a column carries, per effector it moves,
 * {@code axis × (effector − pivot)} — axes straight from the ZYX gimbal
 * frames, see {@link IKTree#channelAxis}), solves the damped normal equations
 * {@code (J·W²·Jᵀ + λ²I)·y = error} — a 3k×3k symmetric positive-definite
 * system (k = effectors), by Cholesky — steps the angles by {@code W²·Jᵀ·y},
 * clamps them into their per-axis limits, and re-poses the tree. Shared bones
 * NEGOTIATE between goals through the shared columns; effector weights scale
 * their rows, so a lighter goal yields where goals conflict.
 *
 * <p>The step is MONOTONE in the combined weighted error: a step that made it
 * worse is retried with the limit-cut channels frozen (active set — a clamped
 * step is no longer a descent direction), then backtracked at halved scales;
 * the cap on a large step scales the WHOLE delta vector, never per-channel
 * (a per-channel clamp degenerates the direction into a vector of signs).
 *
 * <p>Locks, limits and stiffness live per axis on {@link IKJoint}. The pole is
 * Blender's root twist about the root→goal line; on a SINGLE chain it is
 * applied before the iterations and re-applied exactly after them (root and
 * goal sit on the line, so the twist cannot disturb that chain's reach). On a
 * merged tree poles are pre-applied only — an exact post-twist of one chain
 * would move the OTHER chains' effectors — and the goal pre-alignment and
 * extension-break degeneracy cures stay single-chain-only for the same
 * reason. A chain whose root or first interior joint is NOT fully movable
 * gets neither the rigid twist nor the analytic pre-pose (both would trample
 * the locked channels) — its pole acts through weak in-Jacobian rows instead,
 * see {@link #buildBiases}. Everything is radians and world units; the solve
 * is stateless.
