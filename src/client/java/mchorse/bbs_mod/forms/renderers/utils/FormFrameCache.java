/**
 * One pose evaluation shared for the span of a render pass — the first piece of "the frame is an object".
 *
 * <p>A form's bone matrices are not stored anywhere: {@link mchorse.bbs_mod.cubic.ModelInstance} is a single
 * globally cached asset per model id, and the evaluated pose lives in the asset's own
 * {@link mchorse.bbs_mod.cubic.data.model.ModelGroup#current} fields. So the only way to <em>read</em> a pose
 * is to re-run the whole pipeline (reset &rarr; actions &rarr; pose stack &rarr; IK) via
 * {@link mchorse.bbs_mod.forms.renderers.FormRenderer#collectMatrices(IEntity, float)}, which is what every
 * consumer does today — the anchor chain, the gizmo, the axes preview, trackers, the motion path. In a scene
 * with anchors that is the same full evaluation several times per form per frame, and twice again for the
 * stencil picking pass.</p>
 *
 * <p>This class holds the result of that evaluation so a stretch of code that needs it more than once pays
 * for it once. It is deliberately <b>not</b> an ambient global with a frame counter: the pose is mutable
 * global state that several stages write mid-frame (the animation states applied inside
 * {@link mchorse.bbs_mod.forms.renderers.FormRenderer#render}, the IK/physics target overrides filled by the
 * film controller), so "the last evaluation this frame" is not a well-defined value. Instead a cache is
 * created explicitly for a span in which nothing can mutate the pose — adjacent statements — and passed down
 * as a parameter. Every entry point keeps a cache-less overload that behaves exactly as before, so a caller
 * that has not been reviewed for such a span simply passes {@code null} and re-evaluates.</p>
 *
 * <p>When the pose moves out of the asset and into a per-instance buffer, this is the seam it lands on: the
 * cache becomes the frame's pose storage and the "evaluate" call below becomes a pure function of the
 * document, at which point the pass scoping can widen safely.</p>
