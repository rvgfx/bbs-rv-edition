/**
 * "Render last": a form with {@link Form#renderLast} set skips its turn in the draw order and
 * draws after every other form of the same pass. Forms draw immediately, in list order, with
 * depth writes on — so a semi-transparent pixel drawn early hides whatever draws later behind
 * it, and the cure used to be reordering the replay list by hand. This is that reorder as a
 * per-form switch, the Blockbuster "render last".
 *
 * <p>Unlike {@link FormTranslucentQueue} it never moves a form into another phase of the frame:
 * the postponed forms go through the ordinary {@link FormUtilsClient#render} at the end of the
 * very pass that skipped them — same programs, same frame state, only later than their
 * neighbours. That is what keeps it sound under shader packs, where the queue's end-of-frame
 * replay lands past a deferred pack's lighting composite. What it cannot do is order surfaces
 * within one object, or two "last" forms against each other — those keep the list order.</p>
 *
 * <p>A pass wraps its form drawing in {@link #open()} / {@link #close(boolean)}; close draws
 * the postponed forms in the order they were skipped. Scopes nest: opening inside an open
 * scope opens nothing, and the forms wait for the outer close. What is captured is the form's
 * frame — matrices, light, camera — not its geometry: the replay runs the renderer again, so
 * animation, IK and physics evaluate at replay time, still within the same frame. A postponed
 * form takes its body parts with it, they draw inside its renderer.</p>
