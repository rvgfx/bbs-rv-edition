/**
 * The model editor of the model panel: the model itself rather than its configuration. Its groups
 * and their cubes as one tree ({@link UIModelTree}); rows of either kind added, duplicated,
 * removed, renamed and dragged where they belong — and for the picked one its rest,
 * the pivot it turns about and the rotation it rests at, on the viewport gizmo and in a transform
 * editor. For a picked cube, its numbers: where it starts, how big it is, the pivot it turns
 * about, its rotation and its inflate. Edits land in the live model (the preview shows them at
 * once), go on the panel's undo stack as snapshots of the model ({@link ModelEditUndo}), and the
 * panel writes the file on save.
 *
 * <p>The transform editors work in radians on stand-in transforms; the model rests in degrees.
 * A stand-in is loaded from the group or the cube on every fill and pushed back after every edit
 * — and every frame while it's picked, since a gizmo drag's sampling nudges the stand-in and
 * re-evaluates the model through it. The cube's is read as a CHANGE from where the edit began
 * ({@link ModelCubeEdit}), so a move of the cube's corner takes its pivot along (the cube moves as
 * a whole), the pivot on its own row moves the point alone, and every other cube of the pick takes
 * the same change.</p>
 *
 * <p>A group has one point — the pivot it turns about, which is also where it stands in the model
 * — and moving it means one of two things. The gizmo MOVES THE GROUP: its cubes and its whole
 * subtree's go along, since a cubic model's cubes are absolute and the hierarchy passes down
 * rotations alone. The row under the tree moves THE POINT ALONE, leaving the geometry where it
 * stands, so the group turns about somewhere else. The sphere over the tree puts the gizmo on
 * the point too, for when that is what's wanted. A cube's rows read the same way round: its
 * position row moves the cube as a whole, the pivot row below moves its point alone. Its gizmo
 * stands on that pivot and turns as the cube does — the rings turn the cube about it, and the scale
 * handles grow it about the same point. A group's rest has no scale of its own, so a group's scale
 * handles grow its whole branch about the group's pivot instead ({@link ModelBranchScale}).</p>
 *
 * <p>Several rows can be picked at once (ctrl / shift, as in every list here), and a picked group
 * takes the cubes of its whole branch along ({@link #pickedCubes}): the verbs — copy, remove —
 * then work on the whole pick as one undo step, and so does moving it. The fields and the gizmo
 * sit on the FIRST of the pick, and what it is moved by is given to every other picked row, in the
 * same terms — geometry travels with geometry, points with points, keeping the distances between
 * them. A cube's other rows — its size, rotation, pivot and inflate — change every cube of the pick
 * by the same amount, each from its own numbers, the way the pose editor edits a pick of bones; a
 * paste or a reset puts the same numbers on all of them. On a pick of cubes alone the gizmo scales
 * and turns as well, every cube about its own pivot ({@link ModelCubeEdit}). A name is one row's
 * own, so it goes dead while more than one is picked. The picked cubes light up in the viewport
 * ({@link #outlines}).</p>
 *
 * <p>Changed numbers leave their groups' quads and the model's bake behind; they are rebuilt once
 * the numbers have settled ({@link #settle}) — after a typed edit at once, after a gesture at its
 * end.</p>
 *
 * <p>Bound per fill: the tree keeps its pick across one by address, since a save reloads the
 * model and every group object with it — and so does every edit of the structure, which settles
 * the model again through the panel.</p>
