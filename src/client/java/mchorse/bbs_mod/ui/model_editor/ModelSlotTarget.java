 * rather than the model's own numbers — what pushes the stand-in into the model before the bone
 * is evaluated afresh ({@code apply}; null when the transform is the model's), which handles the
 * gizmo offers ({@code mask}; null for all of them) — a rest shared by several picked bones can
 * only be moved — and, for a {@link ModelSlotKind#CUBE}, which cube of the bone it is
 * ({@code cube}; -1 for a target that isn't one).
