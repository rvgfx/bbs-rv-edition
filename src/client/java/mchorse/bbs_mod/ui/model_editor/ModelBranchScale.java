/**
 * One scale of a group's whole branch about the group's pivot — what the gizmo's scale handles do
 * to a picked group — carried from where the branch stood when it began.
 *
 * <p>Everything under the group grows about its pivot by the factor, axis by axis: every cube's
 * corner, size and pivot, the pivot of every group below it (the pose's with the rest's, as a move
 * takes both), every vertex of every mesh, shape keys and all. The group's own pivot is the centre
 * and stays. A cube's inflate grows too while the factor is the same on every axis — it is one
 * number for every side, and a stretch along one axis has no one inflate to give. A mesh's normals
 * lean against a stretch, as normals do.</p>
 *
 * <p>Rotations stay as they are. A factor the same on every axis is exact for all of the branch; a
 * stretch along one axis is exact for whatever isn't turned against that axis. A turned cube
 * stretched across its turn would stop being a box, and scaling its own size is the nearest a cube
 * can come; so is the content of a turned group below, and a turned mesh, whose origin stays where
 * it is, the way a move leaves it ({@code Model#shiftGroup}).</p>
 *
 * <p>Every number is worked out afresh from the start on every change, and an axis whose factor is
 * exactly one keeps its start to the bit — a gesture let go with Escape leaves no trace in the
 * file.</p>
