/**
 * One edit of the numbers of a pick of cubes, carried from where the cubes stood when it began.
 *
 * <p>The cube rows show one cube of the pick — the leader — and what is dragged into them, or
 * pulled with the gizmo, is a CHANGE, which every cube of the pick takes from its own numbers:
 * cubes two, three and six wide are four, five and eight wide once the leader's width is dragged
 * from two to four. A number TYPED into a row is every cube's number instead — Blockbench's rule
 * for a pick, and the way it reads: typing 4 asks for four. The gizmo shares a change in its own
 * terms ({@link Source}): its scale handles scale, so every cube grows by the leader's FACTOR,
 * about its own pivot, where the rows grow each out of its corner; and its rings turn, so every
 * cube turns by the leader's TURN about its own pivot, where the rows add to each angle — about
 * the same axes, or on a ring of the leader's own frame each about its own, as Blockbench turns a
 * pick.</p>
 *
 * <p>Every number is worked out afresh from the start of the edit on every change rather than
 * nudged from where the last change left it. A drag's many small steps would otherwise pile up
 * rounding on every cube but the leader, and the gizmo's probes — which pull the leader's numbers
 * far off and back before a drag even starts — would leave it behind in the file; from the start,
 * a change that comes back to nothing lands every cube on exactly the numbers it began with. The
 * change is measured against the editor's own numbers as they stood before the edit ({@code from})
 * rather than against the leader cube, for the same reason: the editor keeps its rotation in
 * radians, and a change of nothing must stay nothing rather than a trip through degrees.</p>
 *
 * <p>Only what the edit has changed so far is written. A move of a picked group carries that
 * group's cubes along by itself, and a cube the edit merely holds for its size must not be put back
 * where it started underneath it. One edit changes one thing — a gesture that switches from moving
 * to scaling rewinds first — so the fields never fight; if they ever did, the corner is moved first
 * and grown about the moved pivot second, which is what the two in a row would do.</p>
