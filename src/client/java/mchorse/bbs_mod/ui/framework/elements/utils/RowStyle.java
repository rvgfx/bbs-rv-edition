/**
 * The one vocabulary every row of every list speaks — timeline tracks, folder trees, replay
 * categories, texture layers, morph sections.
 *
 * <p>Every mark here is the same shape: a gradient across the row with a solid bar down its left
 * edge. That is the mark {@link Batcher2D#highlight} already puts on the chosen tab, mode and
 * tool, so a picked row and a pressed tool now say "this one" the same way. Rows carry text over
 * the mark and there are many of them at once, so the wash is softer than a tab's — the same mark,
 * said quieter.</p>
 *
 * <p>What tells the states apart is <b>where the colour comes from</b>, not the shape:</p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li><b>Whose row this is</b> — the row's own colour, if it has one: a track's colour, a
 *     category's colour. The bar alone, never a wash. Belonging is a standing fact about a row
 *     rather than something happening to it, and a list whose every row is washed in its own
 *     colour is a list where the cursor has nothing left to say.</li>
 *     <li><b>The cursor is here</b> — the row's own colour where there is one, the accent
 *     otherwise. That is what keeps the timeline's coloured hovers, which are the reason this
 *     vocabulary exists at all.</li>
 *     <li><b>This is the pick</b> — always the accent, and always the strongest thing on the row.
 *     A row that has a colour of its own keeps its bar, so being picked never costs it its
 *     category.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Hover and pick are told apart by the bar, not by opacity alone: only a picked row has one
 * (or, having one already, gets the accent laid over it). Two washes of the same colour at
 * different strengths would be a guess; a bar is either there or it is not.</p>
 *
 * <p>The bar goes down last, over every wash, so it stays the one hard edge on the row however
 * many marks the row is wearing. A row with no bar — a section header, which is a whole strip
 * rather than one of a list — simply gets the wash, edge to edge.</p>
