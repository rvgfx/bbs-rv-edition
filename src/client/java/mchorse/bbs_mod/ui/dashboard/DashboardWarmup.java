/**
 * Builds the dashboard ahead of the user asking for it.
 *
 * <p>The dashboard is built the first time it is opened, and the whole of it lands in that
 * one frame — the key is pressed, and the game stops for as long as every panel takes. The
 * work itself is unavoidable, but the moment isn't: this moves it to where the player is
 * already waiting, one {@link UIDashboard#buildNextStep() step} at a time.</p>
 *
 * <p>The moment worth having is the world still loading: nobody is looking at anything but a
 * progress bar, so building takes as much of the tick as it is given.
 * The terrain screen stays up until building finishes, including on a quick join. If a
 * custom loading screen bypasses it, leftovers are picked up one step at a time.</p>
 *
 * <p>Panels touch the UI and OpenGL, so every step runs on the render thread, the same as it
 * always did — this only moves it earlier, never off the thread.</p>
