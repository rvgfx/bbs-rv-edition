/**
 * The mouse while an actor is being driven by hand: either it looks around, the way it does in
 * the game, or it becomes a gamepad stick that writes into the actor's extra variables — the
 * left and right sticks, the triggers, and the two spare pairs.
 *
 * <p>The mode is a walk, not a set: the same key steps through look → left stick → right stick
 * → triggers → extra 1 → extra 2 and around again, which is why it is kept as a counter and
 * read modulo six rather than clamped.
 *
 * <p>Stick values are NOT this object's truth — the actor's variables are. Switching to a stick
 * reads the actor's current values back into the stick so it picks up where the channel left
 * off instead of snapping to centre.
