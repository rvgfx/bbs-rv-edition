/**
 * The gizmo target for a replay's own placement in the world &mdash; where the actor
 * stands and which way it faces &mdash; as opposed to a bone inside its form.
 *
 * <p>A replay has no {@link Transform}: its placement lives in the keyframe channels
 * {@code x/y/z} and {@code yaw/pitch/headYaw/bodyYaw}. This editor is the adapter
 * between the two. It holds a scratch transform for the gizmo to read and turns every
 * write back into keyframes at the playhead, which is what "the pose on the current
 * frame" means for a record.
 *
 * <p>The mapping, and why:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code translate} is the world position, one unit per block, so the drag needs no
 *     Jacobian of its own.</li>
 * <li>{@code rotate.y} is {@code -yaw} in radians, because the renderer places the whole
 *     actor with {@code rotateY(-bodyYaw)} &mdash; the sign has to match or the actor
 *     would turn against the ring.</li>
 * <li>{@code rotate.x} is {@code pitch}.</li>
 * <li>{@code rotate.z} stays zero and {@code scale} stays one: a record has neither roll
 *     nor size. {@link #MASK} keeps the handles that would drive them off the screen and
 *     out of the pick stencil entirely, rather than letting a gesture start and quietly
 *     go nowhere.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Turning the Y ring moves all three yaw channels by the same amount, keeping the
 * angles they were offset by when the gesture started. Only {@code bodyYaw} turns the
 * actor's matrix, but moving it alone leaves the head aimed where it was and wrings the
 * neck round; the whole-actor turn is also what {@code LOOK_AT} in
 * {@link ReplayBatchProcessor} does to a whole record.
