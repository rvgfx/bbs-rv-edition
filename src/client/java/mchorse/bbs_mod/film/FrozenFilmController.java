/**
 * The film's frame left standing in the world after the film editor's screen goes away.
 *
 * <p>It is the stopped editor without the editor: the same replay entities, the same properties, at
 * the one tick the cursor was sitting on. The tick itself never moves &mdash; nothing here advances
 * it &mdash; so what stays in the world is the frame that was on screen.
 *
 * <p>Whether the forms keep <em>living</em> on that tick is the editor's own call, carried over in
 * {@code animated}: the film editor's "freeze when paused" toggle decides the very same thing for a
 * stopped timeline (see {@code UIFilmController#isPaused}, which is that toggle inverted, and how
 * {@code FilmEditorController} reads it through {@code isPlaying}). Frozen, the frame is a statue;
 * animated, the forms run their own clock and idle away exactly as they did with the editor open.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately blind to the film's actors ({@link #getActors()} returns {@code null}): those are
 * real entities and the player, steered by the server only while the editor holds them, and a frozen
 * frame that kept driving them would keep re-applying a stale tick's position and rotation &mdash;
 * pinning the player in place after they left the UI. Replays flagged as actors therefore leave with
 * the editor; every other replay stays.
