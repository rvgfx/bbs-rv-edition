/**
 * Per-frame call counters for the film editor's hot paths.
 *
 * <p>The main metric is the NUMBER of calls, not milliseconds: "collectMatrices went from 47
 * to 6 per frame" is a deterministic, driver-noise-proof proof that a cache works. Counters
 * are longs in a flat array indexed by {@link Section#ordinal()} — no string keys, no maps,
 * no allocation on the hot path. When {@link #enabled} is false the count call is a single
 * branch the JIT strips.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@link #frame()} is called once per frame at the existing frame boundary
 * ({@code BBSRendering.onWorldRenderBegin}); it snapshots the finished frame for the overlay
 * (so numbers don't flicker mid-frame) and zeroes the live row. Render thread only.</p>
