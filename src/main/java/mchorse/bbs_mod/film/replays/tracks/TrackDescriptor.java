/**
 * One track a form offers: its address and channel, whose it is, what it looks like in a timeline,
 * and where it sits in the tree of tracks.
 *
 * <p>The list of these is what a form <em>has</em> — which is a question about the form, not about a
 * timeline. It used to be answered by the timeline builder itself, in three separate copies (the
 * replay editor, the animation state editor, and the per-form track filter, which built a throwaway
 * {@code FormProperties} just to ask), each knowing a slightly different subset.</p>
 *
 * @param id       address of the track
 * @param channel  its keyframes, taken from the replay's tracks (made on the spot if absent)
 * @param owner    form the track belongs to
 * @param title    what a timeline calls it
 * @param icon     icon a timeline draws next to it
 * @param color    colour a timeline draws it in, before the user's own override
 * @param property the value behind the track: a real form property, or a stand-in carrying the type
 *                 and starting value for the kinds that have no property of their own (bones,
 *                 materials). Null for the solver tracks, whose value is a container the editor
 *                 builds by hand.
 * @param seed     value a brand-new keyframe starts at, when it must not simply be the empty value.
 *                 Null means the empty value (or the property's) is right.
 * @param parent   track this one folds under — a bone under the bone it hangs off, a material's
 *                 properties under that material's texture track. Null for a track that stands on
 *                 its own. How far in a track is drawn follows from this chain, so there is nothing
 *                 to keep in step with it.
