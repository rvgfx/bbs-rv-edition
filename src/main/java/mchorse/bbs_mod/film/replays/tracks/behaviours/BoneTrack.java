     * to whoever else is also driving it. That matters because an animation state releases after
     * EVERY render of the form (see FormRenderer#render), while a film writes its pose once per
     * frame: dropping the pose here would leave the form unposed for every further pass of the same
     * frame — the shadow pass, a second viewport, a preview.
     *
     * Undoing one contribution properly needs the pose to be a stack of contributions rather than one
     * value written in place, which is a separate piece of work.
