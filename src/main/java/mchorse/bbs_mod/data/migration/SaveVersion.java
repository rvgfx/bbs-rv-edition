/**
 * Version of the format BBS' own documents are saved in — one number for the whole mod, stamped at
 * the root of every self-standing save (see {@code BaseManager}).
 *
 * <p>It is deliberately <em>not</em> a per-document-kind counter. A form is not a file but a
 * fragment living inside films, model blocks, morphs and other body parts, so a migration that
 * reshapes a form has to be reachable from every container at once; separate counters would mean
 * the same converter sitting on three independent ladders with three different step numbers. One
 * number costs a document a walk past migrations that didn't concern it, which is a no-op.
 *
 * <p>It is also not a {@code Value} inside the document. The version describes the file, not the
 * thing the user authored — as a value it would show up in panels, in undo, and be editable.
 *
 * <p>Do not confuse it with the {@code "BBS1"} magic in {@code DataStorage}: that identifies the
 * binary container, a layer below the meaning of what is inside it.
