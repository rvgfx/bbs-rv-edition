/**
 * What a .jem does not say about its parts and OptiFine takes from the vanilla model: the part
 * hierarchy, and the rotation points of the parts the file leaves empty.
 *
 * <p>A {@code .jem} lists every entity {@code part} as a flat top-level entry, but OptiFine attaches
 * each part to the matching <em>vanilla</em> entity bone, so the real parent-child structure comes
 * from the vanilla model — not from the {@code .jem} nesting. That structure matters for animation: a
 * part that is a vanilla child of {@code head} must follow the head. Likewise an empty part's rotation
 * point is the vanilla one: a pack keeps most vanilla parts as empty shells at a zero translate and
 * reads their positions — Fresh Animations animates the villager's head about a neck it never draws —
 * and what such a shell holds in OptiFine is vanilla's own pivot. The parser applies the pivots to
 * empty parts only; a part with geometry stays where its file put it.</p>
 *
 * <p>Read off the game by {@code VanillaRigs}; a model's {@code config.json} lays its own
 * {@code cem_parents} over it — see {@link #withParents}.</p>
