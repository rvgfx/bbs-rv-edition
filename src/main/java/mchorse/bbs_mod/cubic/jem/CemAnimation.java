/**
 * A live, procedural OptiFine CEM animation program: an ordered list of {@code variable = expression}
 * statements that are evaluated every frame and written into the model's bones.
 *
 * <p>Unlike BBS's keyframe {@link mchorse.bbs_mod.cubic.data.animation.Animation}, this is not
 * interpolated — it's a per-frame script. The program (parser, statements, bone bindings) is shared by
 * every instance of the model; what persists between frames for one instance lives in a
 * {@link CemState}, which the owning {@link CemAnimator} keeps. Each frame {@link #apply} (1) advances
 * the state's clock (which may re-seed the state — see {@link CemState#advance}), (2) loads the state's
 * {@code var.*}/{@code varb.*} values into the shared variables, (3) feeds render/entity parameters into
 * the {@link CemParser}, (4) seeds every bone's model variables ({@code <bone>.tx/rx/sx/...}) from the pose the
 * vanilla stage left on it, (5) evaluates the statements in order (assignments mutate the shared variables, so
 * later statements see earlier results — including cross-bone references), (6) writes the bone
 * variables back into each bone's transform, and (7) stores the entity variables back (they are the entity's,
 * shared with its other CEM models — see {@link CemVariables}).</p>
 *
 * <p>The variable-to-transform mapping matches Blockbench's CEM animation editor (the reference
 * implementation, {@code blockbench-plugins/.../cem_template_loader.js}). For every bone the rotation
 * is {@code (-rx, -ry, rz)} (radians) and the scale is {@code (sx, sy, sz)}. The position depends on
 * the bone's place in the hierarchy. Blockbench drives a bone's <em>local</em> mesh position (its
 * origin relative to the parent's origin), whereas BBS stores it as a delta off the bone's absolute
 * pivot {@code O = initial.translate}; converting between the two cancels the parent pivot for a
 * direct submodel but not for a deeper one. With {@code Op = parent.initial.translate}:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li><b>Top-level part:</b> {@code translate = (-tx, 24 - ty, tz)} (carries the
 *     {@code Y_OFFSET = 24} entity origin).</li>
 *     <li><b>Direct submodel of a top-level part:</b> {@code translate = (-tx, -ty, tz)}.</li>
 *     <li><b>Deeper submodel:</b> {@code translate = (Op.x - tx, Op.y - ty, Op.z + tz)}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * The seeds are the inverse of each writeback, so an un-driven (or only cross-referenced) bone writes back
 * exactly the pose it came in with.
 *
 * <p>A bone's kind is its place in the <em>file</em>, not in the bone tree. The parser accumulates pivots
 * by file nesting, and the vanilla rig may then hang a part on another part (see
 * {@link JemModelParser}): that part goes parent-relative, while its direct submodels stay direct — a
 * pack writes their positions for the direct mapping, and Fresh Animations' allay carried its head six
 * pixels too high while they were read as deeper ones.</p>
